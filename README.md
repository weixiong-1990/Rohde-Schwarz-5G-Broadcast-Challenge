# Rohde-Schwarz-5G-Broadcast-Challenge
This repository includes the datasets and the solution in Jupyter notebook of **5G Broadcast – R&S Engineering Competition 2019** (website: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22560). 

This solution investigated different machine learning algorithms to predict the requested demands and the advertising earnings of the 5 streams, and the available bandwidth, so as to predict the choice of stream and find an optimal trade-off between customers’ satisfaction level and the advertising earnings of the content provider.
